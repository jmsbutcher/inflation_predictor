# inflation_predictor

A Python app that tracks, analyzes, and predicts future price trends of ordinary consumer products using machine learning.

- The user enters the prices of his or her favorite items at the store after every shopping trip into a user-friendly GUI.
- The program keeps track of the item, the store, the date, and the price.
- On command, the program scrapes a set of economic data points from the web and bundles it all into a machine learning training set.
- The program performs a linear regression algorithm and displays a future price trend on an individual-item-basis. Key timeframes are highlighted, e.g. "The 5lb bag of Red delicious apples from the Wake forest Walmart is predicted to cost $6.44 a month from now (76% accuracy)."
